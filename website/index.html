								<h2>More about this project</h2>
							</header>
							<p><strong>Focus</strong><br />The focus of our project is mainly based on demonstrating certain patterns in price fluctuation that are met for the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, as well as the interpretation of certain values, putting ourselves in the place of an investor in these currencies. For this study, we have been based on the analysis of the 7 most relevant ICOs in the market.</p>
							<p><strong>ICOs</strong><br />An initial coin offering or ICO is a type of cryptocurrency financing. It is a mechanism devised by the community interested in the blockchain to seek financial support for new projects through small amounts of money and investment. A simile in real life is the Kickstarter platform.</p>
							<p><strong>What we do?</strong><br />We analyze the cryptocurrencies from the information provided by the API and once the data is obtained, we could start looking for similarities and common patterns. However, we have focused on the analysis and processing of Big Data since it is the objective of this project and we really do not have the necessary knowledge to try to study the economic impact that these currencies may have.</p>

					<p>This project processes data from static files and dynamic files</p>
					<div class="row gtr-150">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<span class="icon solid style1 major fa-database"></span>
							<h3>Static files</h3>
							<p>Files with historical data of the 7 most relevant ICOs on the market are analyzed and processed, illustrating the variety and quantity of analysis that can be extracted from sources with very specific information. These files have daily values on minimums, maximums or closing, among others, since 2016.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<span class="icon solid style6 major fa-bolt"></span>
							<h3>Dynamic files</h3>
							<p>For this part of the project, we have differentiated two stages:</p>
							<ul class="align-left">
								<li>The first is based on data collection and the second is based on the processing of said information.</li>
								<li>In the first phase, through a Python script, we make use of calls to the COINBASE API to extract monthly information about all the cryptocurrencies collected on this page, throughout 2021. We store this information in CSV files.</li>
								<li>In the second phase the files are processed.</li>
